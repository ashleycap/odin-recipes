        <h3>When to make these pancakes</h3>
        <p> "These are pancakes for people who don't like pancakes." High protein pancakes!</p>
        <p><b>Makes: 4 pancakes</b></p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup strawberries, halved</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons maple syrup, plus more for serving</li>
            <li>2/3 cup cottage cheese</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>4 teaspoons granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 pinch kosher salt</li>
            <li>1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour (or whole wheat/hazelnut mix) </li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>(optional) cinnamon, vanilla extract, cardamom (add to berries)</li>
            <li>Butter for frying</li>

        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a small bowl, stir together the strawberries and maple syrup
            and set aside to macerate.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, prepare the pancakes: Whisk together the cottage
            cheese, eggs, sugar, and salt until smooth and fluffy. Stir in the
            flour and baking powder last.</li>
            <li>Heat a nonstick skillet or griddle over medium heat. Melt about
            a teaspoon of butter and pour in 1/3 cup of the pancake batter. Cook
            2 to 3 minutes on the first side, then flip and continue cooking 1
            to 2 minutes, or until cake has set. Plate, then continue with the
            rest of the batter (you should get exactly four pancakes out of this
            recipe).</li>
            <li>Serve with strawberry maple syrup either on the side or on
            top.</li>
        </ol>
